# Publishing

Publishing components on the Fliplet platform is done via the CLI command `publish` as follows:

```
$ cd my-awesome-component
$ fliplet publish
```

Publishing requires you to log in against your Fliplet Studio account:

```
$ fliplet login
```

The above command will ask for your email and password. Once successfully authenticated, you will be able to publish components, themes and menus on Fliplet.

```
$ fliplet login

Please type your Fliplet Studio login details.

Logged in successfully. You can now publish widgets.
