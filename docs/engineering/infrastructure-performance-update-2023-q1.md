As the head of development at Fliplet, I'm excited to share that our engineering team has been hard at work improving our infrastructure to enhance the performance and scalability of our products and apps.

Over the past few months, we've made significant updates to our distributed database systems, enabling our customers to store millions of records and ensuring high availability of their data.

One of the key improvements we've made is in the **performance of Data Sources**. With our updated infrastructure, everyone can now store and access vast amounts of data with ease. We've optimized the database queries and implemented caching mechanisms to both native and web apps to reduce latency and speed up data retrieval.

In addition, we've reviewed and enhanced our high availability systems to ensure that our customers' data is always accessible, even in the event of hardware failures or other disruptions. With these new systems in place, we're able to guarantee 99.99% uptime for mission-critical apps.

These improvements have been especially crucial for our customers who need to manage large amounts of data across their applications. With the increased storage capacity and improved performance, they can now easily manage and analyze their data, resulting in more informed business decisions.

Overall, our infrastructure update represents a significant investment in the scalability and performance of our products and apps. We're proud to offer our clients a robust, reliable platform that can handle even the most demanding data needs.

Additionally, we've enhanced our **Data Integration Service** for faster and more reliable synchronization between on-prem data centers and our APIs. Our customers can now enjoy a more seamless and efficient data transfer process, resulting in faster time-to-market and reduced downtime. Moreover, we've improved logging and debugging for the software when installed as a Windows Service. This allows engineers to quickly identify and troubleshoot any issues that may arise during the synchronization process.

Furthermore, we've **updated our documentation with more examples** and use cases across our most frequently used JS APIs, like forms, app actions and helpers. This ensures that our customers have the information they need to take full advantage of our platform's capabilities.

Looking ahead, later this year we will be sharing more about the exciting features we are working on, like **hardware security keys** for Fliplet Studio, a **new version of app actions for no-code workflow app building**, and **new components to accelerate building dynamic layouts**. We're committed to staying at the forefront of innovation in the no-code app development space and providing our customers with the tools they need to succeed.

In addition to these new features, we'll continue to invest in our infrastructure to ensure that our platform remains fast, reliable, and scalable. Our engineering team is constantly exploring new technologies to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible with our products and apps, and we look forward to sharing more updates in the near future.
