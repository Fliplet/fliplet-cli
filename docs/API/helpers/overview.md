# Fliplet Helpers

Building custom components using traditional development tools can be difficult: that's why Fliplet has created <strong>Helpers</strong>, a UI framework to easily create custom functionality for your Fliplet apps.

Here's how it works:

1. You define a helper using JavaScript code
2. The helper is shown into the Fliplet Studio components list alongside Fliplet 1st-party components.
3. You drop the helper into your app screens. This creates an helper instance.

As you might be aware of, Fliplet components are also capable of presenting the user a configuration UI to amend their settings once clicked. Helpers easily allow you to define a configuration UI within just a few seconds as you will learn in the next few chapters of the documentation.
