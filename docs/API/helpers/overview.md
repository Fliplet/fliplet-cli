# Helpers

## What are Helpers?

Building custom components using traditional development tools can be difficult: that's why Fliplet has created <strong>Helpers</strong>, a UI framework to easily create custom functionality for your Fliplet apps.

Let's break down how helpers work:

1. You define a helper using JavaScript code
1. The helper is shown into the Fliplet Studio components list alongside Fliplet 1st-party components.
1. You drop the helper into your app screens. This creates an helper instance.
1. Clicking on a helper instance shows its configuration interface.

As you might be aware of, Fliplet components are also capable of presenting the user a configuration UI to amend their settings once clicked. Helpers easily allow you to define a configuration UI within just a few seconds as you will learn in the next few chapters of the documentation.

## Sample use cases

We now know what Helpers are. The next question is "what can we use them for?"

1. Create an accordion
1. Create a decision tree
1. Creating a quiz

...and literally any other use case requiring either static or dynamic content.
