# Fliplet Helpers

Building custom components using traditional development tools can be difficult: that's why Fliplet has created <strong>Helpers</strong>, a UI framework to easily create custom functionality for your Fliplet apps.

Here's how it works:

1. You define a helper using JavaScript code
2. The helper is shown into the Fliplet Studio components list alongside Fliplet 1st-party components.
3. You drop the helper into your app screens. This creates an helper instance.

<p class="quote">Note: <strong>Every time you drop an helper into a screen a new "instance" gets created.</strong> Each helper is independent from each other and you can create as many as you want.</p>

As you might be aware of, Fliplet components are also capable of presenting the user a configuration UI to amend their settings once clicked. Helpers easily allow you to define a configuration UI within just a few seconds as you will learn in the next few chapters of the documentation.
