# `Fliplet.UI`

The `Fliplet.UI` namespace contains several classes for creating UI managed by Fliplet. Where appropriate, the UI would come with the following benefits:

  - Optimized usability across all devices/platforms
  - Support for localization incl. RTL language
  - Support for accessibility
  - Support for appearance settings
  - Centrally managed by Fliplet to maintain support through OS & browser upgrades

All pages load the `fliplet-pages` by default. It includes support for the following UI elements.

  - [Actions](fliplet-ui-actions.md)
  - [Toast](fliplet-ui-toast.md)
    - [Error Toast](fliplet-ui-toast-error.md)

The following UI elements are optionally available by adding extra packages to your app.

  - [Date Picker](fliplet-ui-datepicker.md) (`fliplet-ui-datetime`)
  - [Number Input](fliplet-ui-number.md) (`fliplet-ui-number`)
  - [PanZoom](fliplet-ui-panzoom.md) (`fliplet-ui-panzoom`)
  - [Time Picker](fliplet-ui-timepicker.md) (`fliplet-ui-datetime`)
