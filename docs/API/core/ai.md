# AI (Artificial Intelligence)

<p class="warning">AI features are currently available only to paying customers. These features are still in beta and are subject to change before they are released to all apps and customers.</p>

The Fliplet AI JS API is built on top of the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/docs/api-reference/) to provide developers with an easy way to build AI-powered applications.

These APIs empower your apps with OpenAI models such as `GPT 3.5` to do things like:

- Draft an email or other piece of writing
- Write JavaScript or JSON code
- Answer questions about a set of documents
- Create conversational agents
- Give your apps a natural language interface
- Tutor in a range of subjects
- Translate app screens and much more

## Initialization

The `Fliplet.AI()` function is used to initialize an instance of the AI APIs. It optionally supports the [OpenAI completion attributes](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create) as first argument. These include:

- `model`: ID of the model to use. See the [model endpoint compatibility](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/model-endpoint-compatibility) table for details on which models work with.This defaults to `gpt-3.5-turbo`.
- `temperature`: (Number, defaults to `1`) What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.
- `n`: (Number) How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Defaults to `1`.
- `stop`: (String or Array) Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens, e.g. `["\n"]`
- `max_tokens`: (Number) The maximum number of tokens to generate in the chat completion. The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length.

Here's how you can create a new instance of the AI APIs:

```js
const conversation = Fliplet.AI({
  temperature: 0.8
});
```

## Instance methods

The instance object returned from `Fliplet.AI()` exposes the following methods.

### `ask()`

The `ask` instance function takes a prompt (text message) as first argument and the optional `role` of the author as second parameter. The role values are:

- `user` (default when not supplied)
- `system`
- `assistant`

The `ask` function [response format](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/response-format) follows the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/response-format).

```js
const response = await Fliplet.AI().ask('What are the top trends for 2023?');
```

## Multi-turn conversation (chat)

A multi-turn conversation is about keeping the context of previous messages sent for the conversation instance. Chat models take a series of messages as input, and return a model-generated message as output.

Although the chat format is designed to make multi-turn conversations easy, it’s just as useful for single-turn tasks without any conversations.

An example scenario looks as follows:

```js
// Create a conversation instance
const conversation = Fliplet.AI({ temperature: 1 });

// Create a chat completion and wait for the result from the AI
const firstResponse = await conversation.ask('You are a helpful tech consultant.', 'system');

// Send a follow up message for this conversation
const secondResponse = await conversation.ask('What are the top trends for 2023?');

// Send a follow up message for this conversation
const thirdResponse = await conversation.ask('Write a longer summary for the first trend.');

// You can also access a transcript of the whole conversation
// via the "conversation.messages"
messages.forEach(function (message) {
  // Each message has "role" and "content"
})
```

Typically, a conversation is formatted with a system message first, followed by alternating user and assistant messages.

The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. In the example above, the assistant was instructed with "You are a helpful tech consultant".

The user messages help instruct the assistant. They can be generated by the end users of an application, or set by a developer as an instruction.

The assistant messages help store prior responses. They can also be written by a developer to help give examples of desired behavior.

Including the conversation history via the `conversation` instance generated by the `Fliplet.AI()` function helps when user instructions refer to prior messages. In the example above, the user’s final question of "Write a longer summary for the first trend" only makes sense in the context of the prior messages about the tech trends for 2023. Because the models have no memory of past requests, all relevant information must be supplied via the conversation. If a conversation cannot fit within the model’s token limit, it will need to be shortened in some way.

## Single-turn tasks

If you're looking into interacting with the AI model in single-turn tasks where context isn't shared between requests, you have two options:

1. Use the high-level `Fliplet.AI().ask(message)` JS API
2. Use the low-level `Fliplet.AI.createCompletion({ messages })` JS API

Here's an example of how two individual tasks would be layed out using the first JS API:

```js
const firstResult = Fliplet.AI().ask('Act as a JS developer. Write a function to multiply two numbers.');

const secondResult = Fliplet.AI({ temperature: 2 }).ask('Act as a marketer. Write a welcome email for users that signed up to my website.');
```

As each `Fliplet.AI()` generates its own conversation, doing multiple calls will create separate contexts which don't have a shared conversation history. A less concise example than the above would be:

```js
const firstConversation = Fliplet.AI();
const secondConversation = Fliplet.AI({ temperature: 2 });

await firstConversation.ask('Act as a JS developer', 'system');
await secondConversation.ask('Act as a marketer', 'system');

const result = await firstConversation.ask('Write a function to multiply two numbers');
const result2 = await secondConversation.ask('Write a welcome email for users that signed up to my website');
```

### Manually construct a completion request

When you need access to the [full range of completions options provided by OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create), use the low-level `createCompletion` JS API:

```js
const result = await Fliplet.AI.createCompletion({
  model: 'text-davinci-003',
  prompt: 'Say this is a test',
  max_tokens: 7,
  temperature: 0
});
```

Likewise, you can use the [chat completions OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create) with the same JS API by providing the `messages` attribute:

```js
const result = await Fliplet.AI.createCompletion({
  model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo', // this is the default when the model is not provided
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello!' }]
});
```

## Rate limiting

AI features are currently available only to paying customers. A rate limiting of **up to 10 requests per minute** is currently enforced throughout the entire AI JS API namespace.

## Examples

### Generate a form from the user's prompt

```js
Fliplet.Widget.getSchema("com.fliplet.form-builder").then(async function (schema) {
  const message = `I want you to act as a JSON code generator. Below within ### you will find the a JSON schema of a Form Builder widget. This is the schema that defines the structure of the JSON code that is used to generate the form. The schema is as follows:
  ###
  ${JSON.stringify(schema)}
  ###

  Do not provide any explanations.

  Generate the JSON code for the following form:

  I want a form for a user to accept terms and conditions. The user should type their name and age. 18 is the minimum age required to submit the form. Add some sample content before the "I agree" and "do not agree" options to accept. Display a nice message to the user once the form is submitted.
  `;

  const chat = Fliplet.AI();

  const result = await chat.ask(message);

  // Print the output
  console.log(JSON.parse(result));
});
```
