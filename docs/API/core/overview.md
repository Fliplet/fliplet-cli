# Our core framework

## What is Fliplet Core?

Building apps is hard, hence why we have created a core library which is automatically included in all screens of your app. On the other hand, if you're developing a component you will need to manually add `fliplet-core` to the list of dependencies declared.

The core library enables you to read and write data in the device storage, navigate to different screens and access dozens of other different interactions and features on the device or browser.

<p class="quote"><strong>Tip:</strong> Jump to the namespace you're looking for by using the sidebar on the left.</p>

Features are arranged by namespace, e.g. "<strong>Screen</strong>" is the namespace which contains methods responsible for navigating between screens.
