# 2. Quickstart

## 1. Install Node.js

Our development tools rely on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com). Please install Node.js on your machine before running the next steps.

## 2. Install the Fliplet CLI

The [Fliplet CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fliplet-cli) is available through **Npm** and can be installed from the command line:

```shell
$ npm install -g fliplet-cli
```

Please note: on some systems you might require the `sudo` prefix in order to install the CLI as global (`-g`) on the machine.

Once you have installed the CLI, typing `fliplet` in your command line should print out the available options:

```
$ fliplet

Usage: fliplet [options] [command]

Commands:

  create-widget [name]  Create a new widget.
