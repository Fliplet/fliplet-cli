# Quickstart

Our primary development tool is called [Fliplet CLI](https://github.com/Fliplet/fliplet-cli) (Command Line Interface), it's written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and is available through [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fliplet-cli).

This means in order to start the development you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) on your machine.

The **Fliplet CLI** will enable you to develop and test components and themes on your machine, without having to rely on our APIs or even be connected to the internet while coding.

## 1. Install Node.js

Our development tools rely on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com). Please install Node.js on your machine before running the next steps.

## 2. Install the Fliplet CLI

The [Fliplet CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fliplet-cli) is available through **Npm** and can be installed from the command line:

Please note: on some systems you might require the `sudo` prefix in order to install the CLI as global (`-g`) on the machine.

### How to update the development tools

We regularly update the development tools, so please make sure you're running the latest version when developing components.

To check for updates, use the npm command `outdated`:

```bash
npm outdated
```

To install or update to the latest version, simply run the install command as follows:

```bash
npm install -g fliplet-cli
```

You can see the version you have installed by running the command below:
