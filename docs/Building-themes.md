# Building themes

Before building theme, we recommend reading the documentation about [creating components](Building-components.md) as it contains many principles about how widgets (components, themes and menus) work on Fliplet.

A theme consist in:
- SCSS, CSS and Javascript assets.
- A configuration object which is used from Fliplet Studio to build a UI and let users customise various parts of your theme.
- Sample html files to be used from the CLI to preview a theme during development.
